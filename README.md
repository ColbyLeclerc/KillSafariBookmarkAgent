# KillSafariBookmarkAgent
For some unknown reason, the SafariBookmarksSyncAgent process will continuously eat memory over time. This script checks if the process has exceeded a predefined memory, and kills the process if the limit has exceeded.


# Why not solve the root problem instead of performing symptom management?
After searching the interwebs, the people who have this issue are told to disable iCloud syncing of safari (which I tried), or logout of iCloud entirely and disable syncing (too extreme)
